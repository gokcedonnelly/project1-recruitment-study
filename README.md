# College Recruitment Improvement Study


This is my Project 1 for class. I'm working with survey data from CCM’s Computing Courses to find out how we can improve college recruitment.

I’ll be using Python and Excel to:
1. Come up with questions about the data
2. Clean it up and explore it
3. Make some graphs to show what I find
4. Improve my visuals after getting feedback

Everything I do for the project will be saved in this repo.
